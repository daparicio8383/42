## Libc functions

The term “libc” is commonly used as a shorthand for the “standard
C library” a library of standard functions that can be used by
all C programs (and sometimes by programs in other languages).

In **Libft**, some Libc functions will have to be redone. These
functions will have the **same prototypes and implement the same 
behaviors** as the original ones.
